EC Data Structures and Alogithms
================================

We all know that the Obj-C language is missing some classes and methods that are very usefull when programming.

Mostly inspired in C++ and it's unablity to hold Obj-C objects I'm going to be porting and implementing whatever I think Obj-C could use.

At the time of writing this I've implemented/ported:

- ECStack
- ECQueue
- ECPriorityQueue
- NSMutableArray+reverse(inRange)
- NSMutableArray+nextPermutation

All of this are fully capable of holding Obj-c objects and use blocks for doing the correspondent comparitions.


**Let me know if you find it usefull**
